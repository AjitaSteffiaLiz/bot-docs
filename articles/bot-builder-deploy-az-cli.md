# Deploy your bot

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](./includes/pre-release-label.md)]

After you have created your bot and tested it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere. Deploying your bot to Azure will involve paying for the services you use. The [billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/) article helps you understand Azure billing, monitor usage and costs, and manage your account and subscriptions.

In this article, we'll show you how to deploy C# and JavaScript bots to Azure. It would be useful to read this article before following the steps, so that you fully understand what is involved in deploying a bot.

## Prerequisites

- Install latest version of the [msbot](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/MSBot) tool.
- A [CSharp](./dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart.md) or [JavaScript](./javascript/bot-builder-javascript-quickstart.md) bot that you have developed on your local machine.

## 1. Prepare for deployment
The deployment process requires a target Web App Bot in Azure so that your local bot can be deployed into it. The target Web App Bot and the resources that are provisioned with it in Azure are used by your local bot for deployment. This is necessary because your local bot does not have all the required Azure resources provisioned. When you create a target Web App bot, the following resources are provisioned for you:
-	Web App Bot â€“ you will use this bot to deploy your local bot into.
-	App Service Plan - provides the resources that an App Service app needs to run.
-	App Service - service for hosting web applications
-	Storage account - contains all your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks.

During the creation of the target Web App Bot, an app ID and password are also generated for your bot. In Azure, the app ID and password support [service authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization). You will retrieve some of this information for use in your local bot code. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The language for the bot template for the service must match the language your bot is written in.

Creating a new Web App Bot is optional if you have already created a bot in Azure that you'd like to use.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click **Create new resource** link found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal, then select **AI + Machine Learning > Web App bot**.
1. A new blade will open with information about the Web App Bot. 
1. In the **Bot Service** blade, provide the requested information about your bot.
1. Click **Create** to create the service and deploy the bot to the cloud. This process may take several minutes.

### Download the source code
After creating the target Web App Bot, you need to download the bot code from the Azure portal to your local machine. The reason for downloading code is to get the service references that are in the [.bot file](./v4sdk/bot-file-basics.md). These service reference are for Web App Bot, App Service Plan, App Service, and Storage Account. 

1. In the **Bot Management** section, click **Build**.
1. Click on **Download Bot source code** link in the right-pane.
1. Follow the prompts to download the code, and then unzip the folder.

### Decrypt the .bot file

The source code you downloaded from the Azure portal includes an encrypted .bot file. You'll need to decrypt it to copy values into your local .bot file. This step is necessary so that you can copy actual service references and not the encrypted ones.  

1. In the Azure portal, open the Web App Bot resource for your bot.
1. Open the bot's **Application Settings**.
1. In the **Application Settings** window, scroll down to **Application settings**.
1. Locate the **botFileSecret** and copy its value.

Use `msbot cli` to decrypt the file.

```cmd
msbot secret --bot <name-of-bot-file> --secret "<bot-file-secret>" --clear
```

### Update your local .bot file

Open the .bot file you decrypted. Copy **all** entries listed under the `services` section, and add them to your local .bot file. Resolve any duplicate service entries or duplicate service IDs. Keep any additional service references your bot depends on. For example:

```json
"services": [
    {
        "type": "abs",
        "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
        "subscriptionId": "<subscription-id>",
        "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>",
        "serviceName": "<bot-service-name>",
        "name": "<friendly-service-name>",
        "id": "1",
        "appId": "<app-id>"
    },
    {
        "type": "blob",
        "connectionString": "<connection-string>",
        "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
        "subscriptionId": "<subscription-id>",
        "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>",
        "serviceName": "<blob-service-name>",
        "id": "2"
    },
    {
        "type": "endpoint",
        "appId": "",
        "appPassword": "",
        "endpoint": "<local-endpoint-url>",
        "name": "development",
        "id": "3"
    },
    {
        "type": "endpoint",
        "appId": "<app-id>",
        "appPassword": "<app-password>",
        "endpoint": "<hosted-endpoint-url>",
        "name": "production",
        "id": "4"
    },
    {
        "type": "appInsights",
        "instrumentationKey": "<instrumentation-key>",
        "applicationId": "<appinsights-app-id>",
        "apiKeys": {},
        "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
        "subscriptionId": "<subscription-id>",
        "resourceGroup": "<resource-group>",
        "serviceName": "<appinsights-service-name>",
        "id": "5"
    }
],
```

Save the file.

### Setup a repository

To support continuous deployment, create a git repository using your favorite git source control provider. Commit your code into the repository. 

Make sure that your repository root has the correct files, as described under [prepare your repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment#prepare-your-repository).

### Update App Settings in Azure
The local bot does not use an encrypted .bot file, but the Azure portal has an that you are deploying doesn't 
1. In the Azure portal, open the **Web App Bot** resource for your bot.
1. Open the bot's **Application Settings**.
1. In the **Application Settings** window, scroll down to **Application settings**.
1. Locate the **botFileSecret** and delete it.
1. Update the name of the bot file to match the file you checked into the repo.
1. Save changes.

## 2. Deploy using Azure Deployment Center

Now, you need to upload your bot code to Azure. Follow instructions in the [Continuous deployment to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment) topic.

Note that it is recommended to build using `App Service Kudu build server`.

Once you've configured continuous deployment, changes you commit to your repo are published. However, if you add services to your bot, you will need to add entries for these to your .bot file.

## 3. Test your deployment

Wait for a few seconds after a successful deployment and optionally restart your Web App to clear any cache. Go back to your Web App Bot blade and test using the Web Chat provided in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisite snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-prerequisite.md)]


## Deploy JavaScript and C# bots using az cli

You've already created and tested a bot locally, and now you want to deploy it to Azure. These steps assume that you have created the required Azure resources.

[!INCLUDE [az login snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-az-login.md)]

### Create a Web App Bot

If you don't already have a resource group to which to publish your bot, create one:

[!INCLUDE [az create group snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-az-create-group.md)]

[!INCLUDE [az create web app snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-create-web-app.md)]

Before proceeding, read the instructions that apply to you based on the type of email account you use to log in to Azure.

#### MSA email account

If you are using an [MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account) email account, you will need to create the app ID and app password on the Application Registration Portal to use with `az bot create` command.

[!INCLUDE [create bot msa snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-create-bot-msa.md)]

#### Business or school account

[!INCLUDE [create bot snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-create-bot.md)]

### Download the bot from Azure

Next, download the bot you just created. 
[!INCLUDE [download bot snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-download-bot.md)]

### Decrypt the downloaded .bot file and use in your project

The sensitive information in the .bot file is encrypted.

[!INCLUDE [decrypt bot snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-decrypt-bot.md)]

### Update the .bot file

If your bot uses LUIS, QnA Maker, or Dispatch services, you will need to add references to them to your .bot file. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

1. Open your bot in the BotFramework Emulator, using the new .bot file. The bot does not need to be running locally.
1. In the **BOT EXPLORER** panel, expand the **SERVICES** section.
1. To add references to LUIS apps, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add Language Understanding (LUIS)**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of LUIS applications you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.
1. To add references to a QnA Maker knowledge base, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add QnA Maker**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of knowledge bases you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.
1. To add references to Dispatch models, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add Dispatch**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of Dispatch models you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.

### Test your bot locally

At this point, your bot should work the same way it did with the old .bot file. Make sure that it works as expected with the new .bot file.

### Publish your bot to Azure
