# Deploy your bot using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](./includes/pre-release-label.md)]

After you have created your bot and tested it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere. Deploying your bot to Azure will involve paying for the services you use. The [billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/) article helps you understand Azure billing, monitor usage and costs, and manage your account and subscriptions.

In this article, we'll show you how to deploy C# and JavaScript bots to Azure using `az` and `msbot` cli. It would be useful to read this article before following the steps, so that you fully understand what is involved in deploying a bot.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisite snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-prerequisite.md)]

## Deploy JavaScript and C# bots using az cli

You've already created and tested a bot locally, and now you want to deploy it to Azure. These steps assume that you have created the required Azure resources.

[!INCLUDE [az login snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-az-login.md)]

### Create a Web App Bot

If you don't already have a resource group to which to publish your bot, create one:

[!INCLUDE [az create group snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-az-create-group.md)]

[!INCLUDE [az create web app snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-create-web-app.md)]

Before proceeding, read the instructions that apply to you based on the type of email account you use to log in to Azure.

#### MSA email account

If you are using an [MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account) email account, you will need to create the app ID and app password on the Application Registration Portal to use with `az bot create` command.

#### Business or school account

[!INCLUDE [create bot snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-create-bot.md)]

### Download the bot from Azure

Next, download the bot you just created. 
[!INCLUDE [download bot snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-download-bot.md)]

### Decrypt the downloaded .bot file and use in your project

The sensitive information in the .bot file is encrypted.

[!INCLUDE [decrypt bot snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-decrypt-bot.md)]

### Update the .bot file

If your bot uses LUIS, QnA Maker, or Dispatch services, you will need to add references to them to your .bot file. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

1. Open your bot in the BotFramework Emulator, using the new .bot file. The bot does not need to be running locally.
1. In the **BOT EXPLORER** panel, expand the **SERVICES** section.
1. To add references to LUIS apps, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add Language Understanding (LUIS)**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of LUIS applications you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.
1. To add references to a QnA Maker knowledge base, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add QnA Maker**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of knowledge bases you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.
1. To add references to Dispatch models, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add Dispatch**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of Dispatch models you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.

### Test your bot locally

At this point, your bot should work the same way it did with the old .bot file. Make sure that it works as expected with the new .bot file.

### Publish your bot to Azure

<!-- TODO: re-encrypt your .bot file? -->

[!INCLUDE [publish snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-publish.md)]

<!-- TODO: If we tell them to re-encrypt, this step is not necessary. -->

[!INCLUDE [clear encryption snippet](~/includes/deploy/snippet-clear-encryption.md)]

## Additional resources
